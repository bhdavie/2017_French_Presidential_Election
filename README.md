# 2017 French Presidential Election

## Project Description:
Political science has always been of interest to me. For my third Metis project, I analyzed the 2017 French presidential election and built a model to determine the winner of individual towns throughout the country. I was able to build the model using voting and demographic data from INSEE, the French national statistics bureau.

My analysis is based purely off the datasets I acquired so results may differ slightly from other publications or the media. I also focused my model on town predictions in mainland France; overseas departments and territories were not incorporated in the model.

I hope you enjoy!


## Instructions
All the necessary code can be found in the 'code' folder above. The script titled 'DataFormatting' was used to format the INSEE and voting data. I've already outputted formatted dataframes so you don't need to use the code unless you feel like it. the script titled 'EDA_Modelling' is the exploratory data analysis and predictive modelling script. The script contains many of the bar graphs used in my blog post along with the results of my random forest model for the first and second round of the elections. Finaly, the two heatmaps used in my blog can be found in the script titled 'MapPlotting'. The heatmaps were built using a python package called basemap, so you will need to download the package prior to running the script.
